- First image is most important (it's the primary one)
- Keep **file sizes reasonable** for faster loading

### Image Recommendations:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 500-1000px width recommended
- Quality: Medium to high compression
- Max: 5MB per image, 10 images per product

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Maximum 10 images allowed"
- **Cause**: Trying to upload more than 10 images total
- **Fix**: Remove some images first, then upload new ones

### Images not uploading
- **Fix**: Check Supabase Storage bucket is created and public
- **Fix**: Run `lib/setup_storage.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Currency showing $ instead of ₱
- **Cause**: Browser cache
- **Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache
