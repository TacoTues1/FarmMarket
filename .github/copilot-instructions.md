# Local Farmers' Marketplace System - Project Instructions

## Project Overview
A web-based platform connecting local farmers directly with consumers through a transparent and efficient online marketplace.

## General Objective
The primary objective of this study is to design, develop, and implement a Local Farmers' Marketplace System, a web-based platform that will serve as a bridge between local farmers and consumers. The system aims to simplify agricultural trade by ensuring fairer pricing, providing greater transparency in transactions, and offering wider accessibility to farm-fresh produce. In doing so, it seeks to empower local farmers with digital tools that enhance market visibility while also giving consumers affordable and high-quality products directly from trusted sources.

## Specific Objectives

### Specific
To design and build a web-based marketplace application that enables local farmers to register, create accounts, upload product listings, and directly interact with consumers. The platform will include core features such as product management, order placement, messaging, and farmer profiles to ensure both farmers and buyers can participate in transactions effectively. By providing these functions, the system will directly tackle the problem of farmers' limited market access and consumer reliance on traditional marketplaces.

### Measurable
To ensure that the system is not only functional but also effective and user-friendly, the project will undergo systematic usability testing with a target group of at least 20 potential users, including both farmers and consumers. Success will be measured by the platform achieving at least 80% positive feedback on accessibility, ease of use, and efficiency of transactions. This evaluation will validate that the system meets the needs of its intended stakeholders and provides measurable improvements compared to traditional manual processes.

### Achievable
To develop the Local Farmers' Marketplace using the project team's current knowledge and skills in web technologies such as Next.js, React, Supabase, and database management, while supplementing with new skills in payment integration and data analytics if required. The objective is achievable because the project scope is realistic for the team's level of expertise, and adequate learning resources, mentorship, and development tools are available to support the successful implementation of the system.

### Relevant
To respond to the increasing demand for affordable and sustainable food sources and to support the livelihood of local farmers by providing them with an accessible digital platform. The system's relevance lies in its potential to reduce farmers' dependence on middlemen, increase profitability, and empower communities through fair trade. For consumers, the marketplace will provide convenient access to fresh produce at competitive prices, ultimately contributing to larger societal goals such as food security, agricultural sustainability, and economic resilience.
