# Unified User System - Change Log

## Overview
The Local Farmers' Marketplace System has been updated to use a **unified user system** where all users can both **buy and sell products**. This eliminates the previous distinction between "farmer" and "consumer" roles.

## Key Changes

### 1. Registration System (`app/auth/register/page.js`)
- **Removed**: Role selection (Farmer/Consumer buttons)
- **Removed**: Farmer-specific fields (farm name, location, size, farming type, description)
- **Simplified**: Now only collects basic user information:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Password
  - Phone Number
  - Address
- **Added**: Info banner explaining that all users can buy and sell

### 2. Database Schema (`lib/database.sql`)
- **Updated**: `profiles` table role field
  - **Before**: `CHECK (role IN ('farmer', 'consumer'))`
  - **After**: `role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'` (no restriction)
- **Updated**: `handle_new_user()` trigger
  - **Before**: Created farmer_details for users with 'farmer' role
  - **After**: Simplified to only create profile with 'user' role
  - **Note**: farmer_details table still exists but is optional

### 3. Login System (`app/auth/login/page.js`)
- **Updated**: Redirect behavior
  - **Before**: Farmers → `/farmer/dashboard`, Consumers → `/marketplace`
  - **After**: All users → `/marketplace`

### 4. Navigation (`components/Navbar.js`)
- **Updated**: Menu structure for logged-in users
- **Before**: Different menus based on role (farmer vs consumer)
- **After**: Unified menu showing all features:
  - Marketplace (browse/buy products)
  - My Products (sell/manage products)
  - Cart (shopping cart)
  - My Orders (order history)
  - Messages (communication)

## User Experience

### Registration Flow
1. User visits `/auth/register`
2. Fills out basic information (name, email, password, phone, address)
3. No role selection required
4. Account created with role: 'user'
5. Redirected to login page

### Login Flow
1. User visits `/auth/login`
2. Enters credentials
3. Redirected to `/marketplace`
4. Can access all features from navbar

### Unified Features
All users can now:
- ✅ Browse and purchase products from the marketplace
- ✅ List and sell their own products
- ✅ Manage their product inventory
- ✅ View and manage orders (both purchases and sales)
- ✅ Communicate with other users via messages
- ✅ Add items to cart and checkout

## Database Migration Steps

If you already have users in your database, run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Update existing profiles to use 'user' role
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'user';

-- Update the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, role, phone, address)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 'User'),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'user'),
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'address'
  );
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **Simplified User Management**: One user type instead of two
2. **Increased Flexibility**: Users don't need separate accounts for buying and selling
3. **Better User Experience**: Seamless transition between buying and selling
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Less conditional logic based on user roles
5. **True Marketplace Model**: Anyone can participate as both buyer and seller

## Pages Still Organized by Function

While users are no longer restricted by role, the pages are still organized by function:

- `/marketplace` - Browse and buy products
- `/farmer/products` - Manage products you're selling
- `/farmer/orders` - Orders for products you sold (rename to `/my-sales` recommended)
- `/consumer/cart` - Shopping cart
- `/consumer/orders` - Orders you placed as a buyer (rename to `/my-purchases` recommended)
- `/messages` - All communication

**Recommendation**: Consider renaming paths to be more role-neutral:
- `/farmer/*` → `/selling/*`
- `/consumer/*` → `/buying/*`

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Rename Routes**: Update folder structure for role-neutral naming
2. **Dashboard**: Create unified dashboard showing both buying and selling activity
3. **Profile Page**: Add user profile page with bio and rating system
4. **Seller Verification**: Optional verification badge for established sellers
5. **Product Reviews**: Allow buyers to review sellers and products

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues with the unified user system, check:

3. Supabase trigger recreated
4. Browser cache cleared
5. Server restarted (`npm run dev`)
